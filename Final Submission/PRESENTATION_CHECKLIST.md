# üéØ PRESENTATION CHECKLIST

## Pre-Presentation Setup ‚úÖ

### 1. Environment Preparation
- [ ] Python 3.8+ installed
- [ ] All dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- [ ] Verify datasets are in correct folders
- [ ] Test run the main script once before presentation

### 2. Key Points to Highlight

#### Primary Achievement
- **Self-Data Accuracy: 98.11%** - Demonstrates excellent model learning
- Used Random Forest algorithm with proper train-test validation

#### Technical Excellence  
- **Cross-Dataset Validation** - Real-world model testing approach
- **4 Different Datasets** - Training, Pima, Synthetic, CDC
- **Multiple ML Algorithms** - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Ensemble
- **Advanced Techniques** - SMOTE, feature engineering, domain mapping

#### Real-World Relevance
- **Cross-domain performance** (44-58%) significantly above random (33%)
- **Domain shift challenges** properly demonstrated and addressed
- **Healthcare applications** with biomarker analysis

### 3. Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: Why is cross-dataset accuracy lower?**
A: Domain shift is expected - different data sources, collection methods. 57% vs 33% random shows good generalization.

**Q: What makes this project advanced?**
A: Cross-dataset validation, synthetic data generation, ensemble methods, comprehensive evaluation metrics.

**Q: How is this applicable to real healthcare?**
A: Models trained on one hospital's data must work on other hospitals - this tests that scenario.

### 4. Demo Flow (5-10 minutes)

1. **Quick overview** of project structure
2. **Run the script** - show live execution
3. **Highlight key results** from console output
4. **Show visualizations** (performance_comparison.png)
5. **Explain significance** of results

### 5. Backup Materials
- All files in Final Submission folder
- Screenshots of results (if live demo fails)
- requirements.txt for dependency issues
