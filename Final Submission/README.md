# Cross-Dataset Diabetes Detection - Final Submission

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced machine learning techniques for diabetes detection with a focus on **cross-dataset validation** - a critical real-world challenge where models trained on one dataset must perform well on completely different datasets.
